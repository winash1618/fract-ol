# fract-ol

## Doubts and Clarification
- I am having trouble with installing Minilibx and how to use it.

## Resources

## What are Fractals?
Fractals are very complex pictures generated by a computer from a single formula. They are created using iterations. This means one formula is repeated with slightly different values over and over again, taking into account the results from the previous iteration.

## math.h
- The header file math.h provides function prototypes and macros for working with floating point values.
- If you need to perform mathematical operations on complex floating point numbers should consult the man pages for the complex portion of the math library, via "man complex".
- Try man 3 math on terminal for more information.

## MiniLibX - Simple Graphical Interface Library for students
- The MacOSX operating system handle graphical access to the screen (or "display"). On one side, your software wants to draw something on the screen and/or get keyboard & mouse entries. On the other side, the underlying MacOSX graphical framework that handles the screen, the windowing system, keyboard and mouse. A connection between these two entities must be established.
### Installation
- This is a bit tricky part if you are doing it alone.
- download the .tar folder from the project page.
- untar it and rename it to minilibx
- Now go inside the minilibx folder and run make this will create a libmlx.a file.
### Running your first MiniLibX program
- First of all, you need to initialize the connection between your software and the display. Once this connection is established, you'll be able to use other MiniLibX functions to send the graphical orders, like "I want to draw a yellow pixel in this window" or "did the user hit a key?". The mlx_init() function will create this connection. No parameters are needed, and it will return a void* identifier, used for further calls to the library routines.
```
void  *mlx_init();
```
- let's run our first program 1-started.c given below.
```
#include "minilibx/mlx.h"

int	main(void)
{
	void	*mlx;

	mlx = mlx_init();
}
```
- Now let's create a Makefile to run the above program.
```
NAME		=	1-started
LIBX_DIR	=	minilibx
LIBX		=	libmlx.a
FRAMEWORK	=	-L $(LIBX_DIR) -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit
SRCS = 1-started.c
OBJS		=	$(SRCS:%c=%o)
CC			=	gcc
CFLAGS		=	-Wall -Wextra -Werror -Ofast

%.o : %.c
	$(CC) -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Imlx -c $< -o $@
  
$(NAME) : $(OBJS)
	@$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(FRAMEWORK) -o $(NAME)
  @rm -f 1-started.o

all : $(NAME)
```
- let's create the object file and executable by running make.
- When you run the 1-started file from the terminal you can't help but notice that nothing pops up and that nothing is being rendered.
- Well, this obviously has something to do with the fact that you are not creating a window yet.
- What you just did is to create a initialized the connection between your software and the display.

### Creating a window.
- The mlx_new_window() function creates a new window on the screen, using the size_x and size_y parameters to determine its size, and title as the text that should be displayed in the window's title bar.
- The mlx_ptr parameter is the connection identifier returned by mlx_init(). mlx_new_window() returns a void * window identifier that can be used by other MiniLibX calls. 
- Note that the MiniLibX can handle an arbitrary number of separate windows.
- mlx_clear_window() and mlx_destroy_window() respectively clear (in black) and destroy the given window. They both have the same parameters: mlx_ptr is the screen connection identifier, and win_ptr is a window identifier.
- Return values : If mlx_new_window() fails to create a new window (for wathever reason), it will return NULL, otherwise a non-null pointer is returned as a window identifier. mlx_clear_window and mlx_destroy_window right now return nothing.
```
void *
mlx_new_window ( void *mlx_ptr, int size_x, int size_y, char *title );

int
mlx_clear_window ( void *mlx_ptr, void *win_ptr );

int
mlx_destroy_window ( void *mlx_ptr, void *win_ptr );
```
- Both  X-Window  and MacOSX graphical systems are bi-directionnal.  On one hand, the program sends orders to the screen to display pixels, images, and so on. On the other hand, it  can get information from the keyboard and mouse associated to the screen. To do so, the program receives "events" from the keyboard or the mouse.
- To receive events, you must use mlx_loop (). This function never returns. It is an infinite loop  that  waits for an event, and then calls a user-defined function associated with this event.  A single parameter is needed, the connection identifier mlx_ptr (see the  mlx  manual).
```
int
mlx_loop ( void *mlx_ptr );
```
- Let's create a new window using the above function 2-creating_a_window.c
- To achieve this, we will simply call the mlx_new_window function, which will return a pointer to the window we have just created. We can give the window height, width and a title. We then will have to call mlx_loop to initiate the window rendering. Let’s create a window with a width of 1920, a height of 1080 and a name of “Hello world!”:
```
#include "minilibx/mlx.h"

int	main(void)
{
	void	*mlx;
	void	*mlx_win;

	mlx = mlx_init();
	mlx_win = mlx_new_window(mlx, 1920, 1080, "Hello world!");
	mlx_loop(mlx);
}
```
- here's a make file for the above program.
```
NAME		=	2-creating_a_window
LIBX_DIR	=	minilibx
LIBX		=	libmlx.a
FRAMEWORK	=	-L $(LIBX_DIR) -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit
SRCS = 2-creating_a_window.c
OBJS		=	$(SRCS:%c=%o)
CC			=	gcc
CFLAGS		=	-Wall -Wextra -Werror -Ofast

%.o : %.c
	$(CC) -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Imlx -c $< -o $@
	
$(NAME) : $(OBJS)
	@$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(FRAMEWORK) -o $(NAME)
	@rm -f 2-creating_a_window.o

all : $(NAME)
```
- when you run make from the terminal you will create the executable file and run this executable from the terminal a new empty window will pop up. you have just created you empty first window with the name hello world.
