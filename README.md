## What are Fractals?
Fractals are very complex pictures generated by a computer from a single formula. They are created using iterations. This means one formula is repeated with slightly different values over and over again, taking into account the results from the previous iteration.

## math.h
- The header file math.h provides function prototypes and macros for working with floating point values.
- If you need to perform mathematical operations on complex floating point numbers should consult the man pages for the complex portion of the math library, via "man complex".
- Try man 3 math on terminal for more information.
