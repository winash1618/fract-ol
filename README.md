# fract-ol

## Doubts and Clarification
- I am having trouble with installing Minilibx and how to use it.

## Resources

## What are Fractals?
Fractals are very complex pictures generated by a computer from a single formula. They are created using iterations. This means one formula is repeated with slightly different values over and over again, taking into account the results from the previous iteration.

## math.h
- The header file math.h provides function prototypes and macros for working with floating point values.
- If you need to perform mathematical operations on complex floating point numbers should consult the man pages for the complex portion of the math library, via "man complex".
- Try man 3 math on terminal for more information.

## MiniLibX - Simple Graphical Interface Library for students
- The MacOSX operating system handle graphical access to the screen (or "display"). On one side, your software wants to draw something on the screen and/or get keyboard & mouse entries. On the other side, the underlying MacOSX graphical framework that handles the screen, the windowing system, keyboard and mouse. A connection between these two entities must be established.
### Installation
- This is a bit tricky part if you are doing it alone.
- download the .tar folder from the project page.
- untar it and rename it to minilibx
- Now go inside the minilibx folder and run make this will create a libmlx.a file.
### Running your first MiniLibX program
- First of all, you need to initialize the connection between your software and the display. Once this connection is established, you'll be able to use other MiniLibX functions to send the graphical orders, like "I want to draw a yellow pixel in this window" or "did the user hit a key?". The mlx_init() function will create this connection. No parameters are needed, and it will return a void* identifier, used for further calls to the library routines.
- let's run our first program 1-started.c given below.
```
#include "minilibx/mlx.h"

int	main(void)
{
	void	*mlx;

	mlx = mlx_init();
}
```
- Now let's create a Makefile to run the above program.
```
NAME		=	1-started
LIBX_DIR	=	minilibx
LIBX		=	libmlx.a
FRAMEWORK	=	-L $(LIBX_DIR) -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit
SRCS = 1-started.c
OBJS		=	$(SRCS:%c=%o)
CC			=	gcc
CFLAGS		=	-Wall -Wextra -Werror -Ofast

%.o : %.c
	$(CC) -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Imlx -c $< -o $@
  
$(NAME) : $(OBJS)
	@$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(FRAMEWORK) -o $(NAME)
  @rm -f 1-started.o

all : $(NAME)
```
- let's create the object file and executable by running make.
- When you run the 1-started file from the terminal you can't help but notice that nothing pops up and that nothing is being rendered.
- Well, this obviously has something to do with the fact that you are not creating a window yet.
- What you just did is to create a initialized the connection between your software and the display.
